Mitochondria are unusual organelles. 
They act as the Power Plants of the cell, are surrounded by two membranes, and have their own genome. 
They also divide independently of the cell in which they reside, meaning mitochondrial replication is not coupled to cell division. 
Some of these features are holdovers from the ancient ancestors of mitochondria, which were likely free-living prokaryotes.
Mitochondria are thought to have originated from an ancient symbiosis that resulted when a nucleated cell engulfed an aerobic prokaryote. 
The engulfed cell came to rely on the protective environment of the host cell, and, conversely, the host cell came to rely on the engulfed prokaryote for energy production. 
Gradually, the descendants of the engulfed prokaryote developed into mitochondria, and the work of these organelles became critical to eukaryotic evolution.
The cell membranes protect and organize cells. 
All cells have an outer plasma membrane that regulates not only what enters the cell, but also how much of any given substance comes in. 
Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells also possess internal membranes that encase their organelles and control the exchange of essential cell components. 
Both types of membranes have a specialized structure that facilitates their gatekeeping function.
